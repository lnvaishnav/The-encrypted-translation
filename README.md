# theencryptedtranslation
This project will help the user to translate any sentence from the English language to any language (language codes: ISO-639-1). User can save both files (1. User entered text 2. Translated file) in .txt format and if the user wants the data in PDF format then the user can get its .pdf format also. This project also helps the user to encrypt that .pdf file with a password according to user wish and this step also overwrites the .txt files a message and will clear all the text.
NOTE: 1. User will have to manually give the files name. 
      2. This project is restricted with 500 characters only including whitespaces.
